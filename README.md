# TelegramChatArchiver
Simple Telegram bot to take every message sent in the group/room and send it to the Notion database.

This project was more of a learning project for me, even though it works just fine. I wanted to learn about programing telegram bots
As well as how to use the Notion API. So I merged those intentions to a single project. So if you want to use it or just have it as an example.
Mind that this project might change drasticly as I found new ways to use the Telegram API or the Notion API.
